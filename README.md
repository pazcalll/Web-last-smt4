## Elementary School Scoring System (Laravel Framework)

This project is created to fulfill the last assignment of Advanced Web Programming at JTI Polinema.
This upload is the server side web app of the Elementary School Scoring System itself, which means it is just a half of the entire project. The rest part of this project is available at https://github.com/AbrahamAlier/final-exam-project.git. This server side can handle almost the entire CRUD and bulk import export of the score. The excluded CRUD are edit student's personal data and edit teacher's personal data which is available in the provided link in this description. This server part can see the entire list of the both student and teacher role.
